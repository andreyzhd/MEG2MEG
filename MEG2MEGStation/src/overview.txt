\section dd_sec Project-wide Design Decisions

In some cases "volatile bool" variable is used for interthread communication.
In such cases the variable is not protected by mutex, semaphore or something
similar. This is done to avoid priority inversion and, to a lesser degree, to
make the code more readable. It is assumed that access to a "volatile bool" is
"atomic enough".

Circular buffers are used for "single producer/single or multiple consumer"
interthread communication. We assume that if the buffer is large enough, any
particular data chunk will be retained long enough before being overwritten.
Thus we assume that all the consumers will have enough time to process it
without any need for additional synchronization. 

\section setup_sec Setup Notes

\subsection prio_ssec Permissions for changing priorities
The program needs permissions to elevate process static priorities to work
properly. You need to give the permissions to the user running the program.
This can be done by adding the line

myusername - rtprio 95

to limits.conf (/etc/security/limits.conf, replace "myusername" by the username
of the user running the program).

\subsection cam_ssub Camera permissions
To use the camera the program needs permission to access camera devices. To
make sure that the device created when a camera is plugged in has correct
permissions, create file named /etc/udev/rules.d/10-raw1394.rules containing
the line

SUBSYSTEM=="ieee1394_protocol", MODE="666"
